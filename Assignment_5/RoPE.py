## Part 2: RoPE - Rotary Positional Embeddings

**Background:** Instead of adding position information to embeddings, RoPE rotates
the query and key vectors based on their position. This encodes *relative* position
in the attention scores.

**Key insight:** After rotation, the dot product between $q_m$ and $k_n$ depends
only on the distance $(m-n)$, not absolute positions.

**Your task:** Implement RoPE following the steps below.
